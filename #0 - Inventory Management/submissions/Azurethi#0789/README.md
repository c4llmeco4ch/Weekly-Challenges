~~This is just a sample submission to show folder structure, no cheats here sorry :p~~
Example submission added in "An actual submission"!

# #0- Inventory Management

To get started, with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) V10.16.3 (or compatible) installed, simply navigate to "An actual submission" and run ``node C#0-NodeJS.js``
