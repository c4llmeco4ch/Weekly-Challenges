# #1- A Prisoners Escape (Part 2)

The first part of this challenge was created to allow you your own opportunity to solve the "NIC" challenge on your own, as once you know the solution, it is spoiled.

You'll need to know how I have implemented my own solution to this in order to decode the data hidden within the images. Since this will spoil part 1, I'll omit this here until the challenge is over. Please ask on discord as soon as you've completed Part 1 (or decided to give in, to move on to this more interesting part).

**There is no shame in giving in**, it is a hard puzzle. While there are several solutions online, it'd be best to just contact me for the one I have implemented, as it's the one you'll need to solve this part of the challenge.

Please note: Once you know the solution, you can't un-know it. Whether you get it from me or google. I'd advice you to ponder on it for a few days at least! It will take time.

**Also note: Reading further will potentially give away some hints to part 1**

On contact, I'll tell you my solution for the chessboard puzzle, which resolves the 8x8 grid to a 6 bit key. However, You'll need to expand this to a 16x16 chessboard which will map to a larger key.

Each 16x16 pixel section of the encoded image can be considered to *somehow* contain the Heads/Tails data for a single board, each section will resolve to a key.

This list of keys will *somehow* translate to a message. Which is you're token of victory!

Good luck.

And as always, feel free to message me on discord at any time for hints along the way! (Azurethi#0789)
